The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection is harshly debated, with observational and experimental studies reporting contrasting results. To clarify the role of HCQ in Covid-19 patients, we carried out a retrospective observational study of 4,396 unselected patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Italy (February-May 2020). Patients' characteristics were collected at entry, including age, sex, obesity, smoking status, blood parameters, history of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary diseases, and medications in use. These were used to identify subtypes of patients with similar characteristics through hierarchical clustering based on Gower distance. Using multivariable Cox regressions, these clusters were then tested for association with mortality and modification of effect by treatment with HCQ. We identified two clusters, one of 3,913 younger patients with lower circulating inflammation levels and better renal function, and one of 483 generally older and more comorbid subjects, more prevalently men and smokers. The latter group was at increased death risk adjusted by HCQ (HR[CI95%] = 3.80[3.08-4.67]), while HCQ showed an independent inverse association (0.51[0.43-0.61]), as well as a significant influence of cluster *HCQ interaction (p < 0.001). This was driven by a differential association of HCQ with mortality between the high (0.89[0.65-1.22]) and the low risk cluster (0.46[0.39-0.54]). These effects survived adjustments for additional medications in use and were concordant with associations with disease severity and outcome. These findings suggest a particularly beneficial effect of HCQ within low risk Covid-19 patients and may contribute to clarifying the current controversy on HCQ efficacy in Covid-19 treatment.",

BACKGROUND: Peru was one of the countries with the highest COVID-19 mortality worldwide during the first stage of the pandemic. It is then relevant to evaluate the risk factors for mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in three hospitals in Peru in 2020, from March to May, 2020. Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study. The population consisted of patients from three Peruvian hospitals hospitalized for a diagnosis of COVID-19 during the March-May 2020 period. Independent sociodemographic variables, medical history, symptoms, vital functions, laboratory parameters and medical treatment were evaluated. In-hospital mortality was assessed as the outcome. We performed Cox regression models (crude and adjusted) to evaluate risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Hazard ratios (HR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Results: We analyzed 493 hospitalized adults; 72.8% (n=359) were male and the mean age was 63.3 +/- 14.4 years. COVID-19 symptoms appeared on average 7.9 +/- 4.0 days before admission to the hospital, and the mean oxygen saturation on admission was 82.6 +/- 13.8. While 67.6% (n=333) required intensive care unit admission, only 3.3% (n=16) were admitted to this unit, and 60.2% (n=297) of the sample died. In the adjusted regression analysis, it was found that being 60 years old or older (HR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.14-2.15), having two or more comorbidities (HR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.10-2.14), oxygen saturation between 85-80% (HR=2.52; 95% CI: 1.58-4.02), less than 80% (HR=4.59; 95% CI: 3.01-7.00), and being in the middle (HR=1.65; 95% CI: 1.15-2.39) and higher tertile (HR=2.18; 95% CI: 1.51-3.15) of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, increased the risk of mortality. Conclusions: The risk factors found agree with what has been described in the literature and allow the identification of vulnerable groups in whom monitoring and early identification of symptoms should be prioritized in order to reduce mortality.",

The review comprises in vitro and in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports for the analysis, which were available in medical databases (e.g., PubMed). This manuscript summarizes the current knowledge about chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and shows the difference between their use, activity, recommendation, doses, and adverse effects on two groups of patients: those with rheumatic and viral diseases (including COVID-19). In the case of connective tissue disorders, AMDs are prescribed for a prolonged duration in small doses, and their effect is observed after few weeks, whereas in the case of viral infections, they are prescribed in larger doses for a short duration to achieve a quick saturation effect. In rheumatic diseases, AMDs are well tolerated, and their side effects are rare. However, in some viral diseases, the effect of AMDs is questionable or not so noticeable as suggested during the initial prognosis. They are mainly used as an additive therapy to antiviral drugs, but recent studies have shown that AMDs can diminish the efficacy of some antiviral drugs and may cause respiratory, kidney, liver, and cardiac complications.",

This manuscript summarizes the current knowledge about chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and shows the difference between their use, activity, recommendation, doses, and adverse effects on two groups of patients: those with rheumatic and viral diseases (including COVID-19). In the case of connective tissue disorders, AMDs are prescribed for a prolonged duration in small doses, and their effect is observed after few weeks, whereas in the case of viral infections, they are prescribed in larger doses for a short duration to achieve a quick saturation effect. In rheumatic diseases, AMDs are well tolerated, and their side effects are rare. However, in some viral diseases, the effect of AMDs is questionable or not so noticeable as suggested during the initial prognosis. They are mainly used as an additive therapy to antiviral drugs, but recent studies have shown that AMDs can diminish the efficacy of some antiviral drugs and may cause respiratory, kidney, liver, and cardiac complications.\n\n***OUTPUT FORMAT***\nReturn a JSON object with each topic as a key and 1 (relevant) or 0 (not relevant) as value.\nExample format:\n{\n  \"Treatment\": 0,\n  \"Diagnosis\": 0,\n  \"Prevention\": 0,\n  \"Mechanism\": 0,\n  \"Transmission\": 0,\n  \"Epidemic Forecasting\": 0,\n  \"Case Report\": 0\n}\n\n***YOUR CLASSIFICATION***",

BACKGROUND: British Columbia, like many jurisdictions, has a health information telephone service (8-1-1) to provide callers with information by registered nurses and help them decide whether to attend an emergency department or primary care clinic, or manage their concern at home. We describe a new service, HealthLink BC Emergency iDoctor-in-assistance (HEiDi), that partnered physicians available by videoconferencing with 8-1-1 registered nurses to support callers. METHODS: From Apr. 6 to Aug. 2, 2020, all callers to the 8-1-1 telephone service (available to anyone in BC) categorized as \"\"seek care within 24 hours\"\" by registered nurses were eligible for referral to HEiDi. HEiDi physicians (\"\"virtual physicians\"\") connected directly with callers via desktop videoconferencing software, assessed their health complaint, provided advice and suggested care disposition. We conducted a descriptive study and collected demographic characteristics, health concern and disposition determined by the virtual physician. RESULTS: HEiDi virtual physicians provided 7687 consultations. Most patients (n = 4439, 57.8%) were in the 20-64 age range, and 4814 (62.9%) were female. Common health concerns were related to gastroenterology (n = 1275, 16.6%), respiratory (n = 877, 11.4%) and dermatology (n = 874, 11.4%). From the 7531 calls with available data, 2548 (33.8%) callers were advised to attempt home treatment, 2885 (38.3%) to contact a primary care physician within 1 week, 1131 (15.0%) to attend an emergency department immediately and 538 (7.1%) to attend their primary provider now. INTERPRETATION: We found that virtual physicians were able to advise nearly 3 out of 4 (72.1%) patients away from in-person emergency or clinic assessment and 1 in 7 (15.0%) to seek immediate emergency department care.

In this study, we investigated the effects of human alpha- and beta-defensins and RC101, a theta-defensin analog, on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) 1-3, human defensin (HD) 5 and RC101 exhibited potent antiviral activity against pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.

Pretreatment of cells with HNP1, HD5 or RC101 provided some protection against viral infection.

Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with more than 90 million confirmed cases worldwide. Therefore, this study aims to establish a predictive score model of progression to severe type in patients with COVID-19. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 151 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by nucleic acid test or specific serum antibodies from February 13, 2020, to March 14, 2020, hospitalized in a COVID-19-designed hospital in Wuhan, China. Results Of the 151 patients with average age of 63 years, 64 patients were male (42.4%), and 29 patients (19.2%) were classified as severe group. Multivariate analysis showed that age > 65 years (odds ratio [OR] = 9.72, 95%CI: 2.92-32.31, P < 0.001), lymphocyte count </= 1.1 x 10(9)/L (OR = 3.42, 95%CI: 1.24-9.41, P = 0.017) and AST > 35 U/L (OR = 3.19, 95%CI: 1.11-9.19, P = 0.032) were independent risk factors for the disease severity. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve of the probabilities of the composite continuous variable (age + lymphocyte + AST) is 0.796. Finally, a predictive score model called ALA was established, and its AUC was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.75-0.92). Using a cutoff value of 9.5 points, the positive and negative predictive values were 54.1% (38-70.1%) and 92.1% (87.2-97.1%), respectively. Conclusion The ALA score model can quickly identify severe patients with COVID-19, so as to help clinicians to better choose accurate management strategy.",

Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with more than 90 million confirmed cases worldwide. Therefore, this study aims to establish a predictive score model of progression to severe type in patients with COVID-19.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading contagious infectious disease caused by the pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that primarily affects the respiratory tract as well as the central nervous system (CNS). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the interaction of the viral protein Spike with the angiotensin II receptor (ACE 2), leading to an increase of angiotensin II and activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase2 (NOX2), resulting in the release of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory molecules. The purpose of the review is to explain that SARS-CoV-2 infection can determine neuroinflammation that induces NOX2 activation in microglia. To better understand the role of NOX2 in inflammation, an overview of its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is provided. To write this manuscript, we performed a PubMed search to evaluate the possible relationship of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NOX2 activation in microglia, as well as the role of NOX2 in NDs. Several studies highlighted that NOX2 activation in microglia amplifies neuroinflammation.
